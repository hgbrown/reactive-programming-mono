# Getting Started with Reactive Programming using Project Reactor: Kotlin Mono Examples

A repository demonstrated how to get started with reactive programming using Project Reactor.

The repository contains a single test class that demonstrates a number of ways to construct a `Mono` and how it can be used.

For more context, check out [my blog post](https://hbrown.dev/kotlin/2021/04/25/reactive-programming-with-reactor.html)

This demo depends on:

- Gradle (v 7.0)
- Kotlin (v 1.4.32)
- Spring Boot 2.4.5

## Building the code

To build the code, run:

```shell
./gradlew build
```

## Building the test

```shell
./gradlew test
```
